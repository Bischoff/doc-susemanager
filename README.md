#The SUSE Manager Documentation Update Repository#
![](http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss45/joecayouette/docuimage_2.png)
**This readme is currently under development**

This is the source for the official SUSE Manager documentation update.
This update aims to condense the current six SUSE Manager official documentation books into four brand new manuals. This update will include up-to-date & detailed information covering many subjects generated by feedback from customers, engineers, and sales. A short list of subjects being looked at & in improvment planning include:

* Channel Management
* Channel Assignment
* What is Channel Cloning 
* Cloning Tools
* Custom and Third Party Software
* Patching Systems
* Organization and Group Management
* Activation Key Management
* Bootstrap and Contact Methods: ssh push, pull, osad, saltstack
* Web User Interface
* Command Line Tools
* SUSE Manager Server Setup
* SUSE Manager Proxy
* Autoinstallation
* Best Practice Concepts
* Troubleshooting
* Subscription Counting
* Error feedback & logging
* Salt
* Contact Methods
* API Use
* rhn.conf parameters




*As this is a broad work, many topics to be updated will not be included in this list and topics are subject to change. We will attempt to keep this list up-to-date as documentation develops.*
