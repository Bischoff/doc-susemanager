# SUSE Manager Documentation Repository 

**This readme is currently under development**

This is the source for the official SUSE Manager documentation update.
During the SUSE Manager 3 update we successfully condensed and reworked the six original SUSE Manager documentation books into four shiny new manuals. 

*As this represents a large body of work, many smaller topics/bugs and revisions will not be included. Keep in mind topics are subject to change depending on development priorities. We will attempt to keep this list up-to-date as documentation develops. A new Documetnation updates book is in the works and should be released with 3.1. This document will provide links to all new section content added within a single maintenence update.*
