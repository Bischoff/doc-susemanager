#The SUSE Manager Documentation Update Repository#
![](http://i560.photobucket.com/albums/ss45/joecayouette/docuimage_2.png)
**This readme is currently under development**

This is the source for the official SUSE Manager documentation update.
This update aims to condense the current six SUSE Manager official documentation books into four brand new manuals. This update will include up-to-date & detailed information covering many subjects generated by feedback from customers, engineers, and sales. A short list of subjects being looked at & in improvment planning include:

* Channel Management
* Channel Assignment
* What is Channel Cloning 
* Cloning Tools
* Custom and Third Party Software
* Patching Systems
* Organization and Group Management
* Activation Key Management
* Bootstrap and Contact Methods: ssh push, pull, osad, saltstack
* Web User Interface
* Command Line Tools
* SUSE Manager Server Setup
* SUSE Manager Proxy
* Autoinstallation
* Best Practice Concepts
* Troubleshooting
* Subscription Counting
* Error feedback & logging
* Salt
* Contact Methods
* API Use
* rhn.conf parameters




*As this is a broad work, many topics to be updated will not be included in this list and topics are subject to change. We will attempt to keep this list up-to-date as documentation develops.*

Please do not make any commits to the master branch. master is reserved for releases only. 


##Updating the SUMA 3 Documentation Package (susemanager-docs_en)##

* The build repo is defined in DEF-susemanager_docs
* Perform these steps on both, Head and 3.0 (set the OBS_REPO variable accordingly)


```
OBS_USER=keichwa
OBS_REPO=Devel:Galaxy:Manager:Head

daps -d DC-create-all package-src --set-date=$(date --iso) \
     --def-file DEF-susemanager-docs

# save old checkout
old home:$OBS_USER:branches:$OBS_REPO/susemanager-docs_en

osc -A https://api.suse.de bco $OBS_REPO susemanager-docs_en
cd home:$OBS_USER:branches:$OBS_REPO/susemanager-docs_en
cp ../../build/create-all/package/create-all_en_src_set.tar.bz2 .
osc vc -m "Update text and image files."
osc ci -m "update"

# check results; e.g. with:
osc pr

osc sr -m 'update'

```



##Preparing and Publishing Online Documentation (suse.com/documentation)##

ATM (2016-07-13), you must use a recent `daps` checkout from
`git@github.com:openSUSE/daps.git`.

Switch to the directory of the documentation checkout and enter:

```
.../daps/bin/daps --dapsroot .../daps -d DC-create-all online-docs
```

Repeat it for all the `pdfsub` packages listed in `DEF-susemanager-docs`:

```
.../daps/bin/daps --dapsroot .../daps -d DC-DC-susemanager-getting-started online-docs
.../daps/bin/daps --dapsroot .../daps -d DC-DC-susemanager-reference online-docs
.../daps/bin/daps --dapsroot .../daps -d DC-DC-susemanager-best-practices online-docs
.../daps/bin/daps --dapsroot .../daps -d DC-DC-susemanager-advanced-topics online-docs
```

Copy the results to the results to your `~/Exports` directory.

```
mkdir ~/Export/susemanager-3
cp -va build/{create-all,susemanager-advanced-topics,\
susemanager-best-practices,susemanager-reference,\
susemanager-getting-started}/online-docs/* ~/Export/susemanager-3 
```

Create a bug (Classification: Doc Tools, Product: Doc Production,
Component: SUSE Manager) and ask to update
[http://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3](http://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3)
accordingly.  As an example, see [bug
975925](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=975925) or [bug
981142](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=981142).


##Updating SUSE Manager API Documentation and Posting Online##

SUSE Manager 3 (SLE 12 SP1 example):

```
# rename existing directory
old binaries

# checkout the official binary packages
iosc getbinaries SUSE:SLE-12-SP1:Update:Products spacewalk-java standard x86_64

# get the docbook file
unrpm binaries/spacewalk-java-apidoc-sources*
# ==>
# usr/share/doc/packages/spacewalk-java/xml/susemanager_api_doc.xml

# build the PDF with daps:
daps -m usr/share/doc/packages/spacewalk-java/xml/susemanager_api_doc.xml pdf
```

Then create a bug (Classification: Doc Tools, Product: Doc Production,
Component: SUSE Manager) and ask to update
suse.com/documentation/suse-manager-3 accordingly.  As an example, see
https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=976225 .

##Publishing Release Notes on https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/##

If not already done, ask Rudi or Lars (Vogt) to mirror the release notes
from the release repo, and then add the new version to
https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/ .  After publishing the first update,
you probably ask Rudi or Lars again to the mirror script.
