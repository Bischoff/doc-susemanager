Formulas are pre-written Salt states, that are used to configure your {smr} installation.

This section lists the primary formulas shipped with {smr} and their configuration options.


.Salt State Name Clashes
[IMPORTANT]
====
If a Salt Formula uses the same name as an existing Salt State, the two names will collide, and could result in the formula being used instead of the state.
Always check states and formulas to avoid name clashes.

[[retail.sect.formulas.image-sync]]
== Image Sync Formula

The Image Sync formula ([package]``image-sync-formula``) is a formula for syncing images to a Branch Server.

For now, there is nothing configurable and it is not part of the highstate.
This means it is not visible in the {webui}.  Apply it from the command-line or via cron as follows (replace _<branchserver>_ with the name of your branch server):

----
salt <branchserver> state.apply image-sync
----
