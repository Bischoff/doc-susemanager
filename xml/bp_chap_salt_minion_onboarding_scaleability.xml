        <title>Salt Minion Onboarding Rate</title>
        <para>The rate at which SUSE Manager can on-board minions (accept Salt keys) is limited and
            depends on hardware resources. On-boarding minions at a faster rate than SUSE Manager is
            configured for will build up a backlog of unprocessed keys slowing the process and
            potentially exhausting resources. It is recommended to limit the acceptance key rate
            pro-grammatically. A safe starting point would be to on-board a minion every 15 seconds,
            which can be implemented via the following command:</para>
        <screen>for i in `seq 1 1000`; do salt-key -y -a minion$i; sleep 15; done</screen>

        <title>Minions Running with Unaccepted Salt Keys</title>
        <para>Minions which have not been on-boarded, (minions running with unaccepted salt keys)
            consume resources, in particular inbound network bandwidth for ~2.5Kb/s per minion. 1000
            idle minions will consume around ~2.5Mb/s, and this number will drop to almost 0 once
            on-boarding has been completed. Limit non-onboarded systems for optimal
            performance</para>

        <para>Salt's official documentation suggests the maximum number of opened files should be
            set to at least 2x the minion count. Current default is 16384, which is sufficient for
            ~8000 minions. For larger installations, this number may be increased by editing the
            following line in
            <filename>/usr/lib/systemd/system/salt-master.service</filename>:</para>
        <screen>LimitNOFILE=16384</screen>
