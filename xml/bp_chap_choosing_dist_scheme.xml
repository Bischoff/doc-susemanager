    <title>Managing Entitlement Methods</title>
    <para>There are two methods for managing your subscriptions and entitlements. Both management
        methods access &scc; and provide specialized benefits. Directly connecting to &scc; is the
        recommended default way of managing your &susemgr; Server. If you have special network
        security requirements which do not allow access from your internal network the internet then
        you may use a &sle; 12 SP1 Server running the Subscription Management Tool (SMT) for
        maintaining your entitlements. This tool will contact &scc; and obtain updates for your
        clients which you may then mount on your &susemgr; Server  for providing updates. This is
        the preferred method for managing client systems within a highly secure network
        infrastructure.</para>
