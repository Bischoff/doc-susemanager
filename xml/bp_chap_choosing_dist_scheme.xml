                    Server running the Subscription Management Tool (SMT) for maintaining your
                    entitlements. This tool will contact &scc; from a system connected to the
                    external network and obtain updates for your clients which you may then mount on
                    your internal &susemgr; Server. This is the preferred method for managing client
                    systems within a highly secure network infrastructure.</para>

        <title> Overview SUSE Customer Center (SCC) </title>
        <para>SUSE Customer Center (SCC) is the central place to manage your purchased SUSE
            subscriptions and entitlements, helping you access your update channels and get in
            contact with SUSE experts. The user-friendly interface gives you a centralized view of
            all your SUSE subscriptions, allowing you to easily find all subscription information
            you need. The improved registration provides faster access to your patches and updates.
            SUSE Customer Center is also designed to provide a common platform for your support
            requests and feedback. Discover a new way of managing your SUSE account and

        <title>Subscription Management Tool (SMT) and Disconnected Setup (DMZ)</title>

        <para>If it is not possible to connect SUSE Manager directly or via a proxy to the Internet,
            a disconnected setup in combination with Subscription Management Tool (SMT) is the
            recommended solution. In this scenario, SMT stays in an “external” network with a
            connection to &scc; and synchronizes the software channels and repositories on a
            removable storage medium. Then you separate the storage medium from SMT, and mount it
            locally on your SUSE Manager server to read the updated data. </para>

        <para>The following procedure will guide you through using (SMT).</para>

                            this data.</para>
