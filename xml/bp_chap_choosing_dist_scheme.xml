    <title>Managing Entitlement Methods</title>
    <para>There are two methods for managing your subscriptions and entitlements. Both management
        methods access &scc; and provide specialized benefits. Directly connecting to &scc; is the
        recommended default way of managing your &susemgr; Server. If you have special network
        security requirements which do not allow access from your internal network the internet then
        you may use a &sle; 12 SP1 Server running the Subscription Management Tool (SMT) for
        maintaining your entitlements. This tool will contact &scc; and obtain updates for your
        clients which you may then mount on your &susemgr; Server  for providing updates. This is
        the preferred method for managing client systems within a highly secure network
        infrastructure.</para>

        <title> Overview SUSE Customer Center (SCC) </title>
        <para>SUSE Customer Center (SCC) is the central place to manage your purchased SUSE
            subscriptions and entitlements, helping you access your update channels and get in
            contact with SUSE experts. The user-friendly interface gives you a centralized view of
            all your SUSE subscriptions, allowing you to easily find all subscription information
            you need. The improved registration provides faster access to your patches and updates.
            SUSE Customer Center is also designed to provide a common platform for your support
            requests and feedback. Discover a new way of managing your SUSE account and
            subscriptions via one interfaceâ€”anytime, anywhere. </para>

        <title>Overview Subscription Management Tool and Disconnected Setup (DMZ)</title>
        <para>Managing server subscriptions and support entitlements is easy with <link

            <title>Subscription Management Tool</title>
            <para>SMT for &sle; helps customers manage their &sle; software updates while
                maintaining corporate firewall policy and regulatory compliance requirements. It
                establishes a proxy system for &scc; with repository and registration targets. This
                helps you centrally manage software updates within the firewall on a per-system
                basis while maintaining your corporate security policies and regulatory compliance.
                The downloadable Subscription Management Tool is integrated with SUSE Customer
                Center and provides a repository and synchronized registration target. This is very
                helpful in tracking entitlements in large deployments. The Subscription Management
                Tool also maintains all the capabilities of SUSE Customer Center while allowing a
                more secure centralized deployment. It is included with every SUSE Linux Enterprise
                subscription and, as a result, is fully supported. The Subscription Management Tool
                informs your SUSE Linux Enterprise devices of any available software updates. Each
                device then obtains the required software updates from the Subscription Management
                Tool. The introduction of the Subscription Management Tool improves the interaction
                among SUSE Linux Enterprise devices within the network and simplifies how they
                receive their system updates. </para>
