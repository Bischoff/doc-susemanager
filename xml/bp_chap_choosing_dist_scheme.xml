                 <para>SMT for &sle; helps customers manage their
            &sle; software updates while maintaining corporate firewall policy and regulatory
            compliance requirements. It establishes a proxy system for &scc; with repository and
            registration targets. This helps you centrally manage software updates within the
            firewall on a per-system basis while maintaining your corporate security policies
            and regulatory compliance. The downloadable Subscription Management Tool is
            integrated with SUSE Customer Center and provides a repository and synchronized
            registration target. This is very helpful in tracking entitlements in large
            deployments. The Subscription Management Tool also maintains all the capabilities of
            SUSE Customer Center while allowing a more secure centralized deployment. It is
            included with every SUSE Linux Enterprise subscription and, as a result, is fully
            supported. The Subscription Management Tool informs your SUSE Linux Enterprise
            devices of any available software updates. Each device then obtains the required
            software updates from the Subscription Management Tool. The introduction of the
            Subscription Management Tool improves the interaction among SUSE Linux Enterprise
            devices within the network and simplifies how they receive their system updates.
