    <sect1>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para> This chapter provides an introduction to using the new Salt features added in
            &susemgr;Â 3. This chapter assumes you have completed all former sections within the
            &mgrgetstart;. <remark>Add links to onboarding salt minions from former
                sections.</remark> You should have a running &susemgr; server and at least two
            on-boarded Salt minions to complete the sections of this chapter. If you find yourself
            stuck at any point refer to the <citetitle>SaltStack Get Started</citetitle> tutorial
            located at <link
                xlink:href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/getstarted/fundamentals/index.html"/>. </para>

        <tip>
            <title>Use More than One Minion</title>
            <para>Connecting two or more minions during your testing is considered best practice.
                Using two or more minions will allow you to target individual systems using Salt and
                experiment with the power of its targeting features.</para>
        </tip>

        <para> This guide does not attempt to cover all that Salt has to offer. This guide is a
            primer for using Salt with &susemgr;. For comprehensive Salt documentation, see <link
                xlink:href="https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/contents.html"/>. </para>

        <title>Basic Salt Commands</title>
        <para>In the following section you will view and test several basic Salt commands and test
            Salt in master-less mode.</para>
        <tip>
            <title>Terminology</title>
            <para>Throughout this guide you will see the term master. Anytime master is mentioned it
                is referring to the SUSE manager server. </para>
        </tip>

            <title>Salt test.ping</title>
            <procedure>
                <title/>
                <step>
                    <para>In a terminal on the Salt master run the following command as root:</para>
                    <screen># salt-key</screen>
                    <para>The <command>salt-key</command> command lists all accepted minion keys and
                        their names. If you have added minions via the SUSE manager on-boarding page
                        you will see those minions listed here. You can target a minion based on the
                        listed name.</para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>Send a <command>test.ping</command> to a minion with the following Salt
                        command:</para>
                    <screen># salt minion_name test.ping</screen>
                    <para>If the accepted minion is running it will return
                        <command>True</command>.</para>
                    <tip>
                        <title>Salt Command Format</title>
                        <para>The format of a Salt command is:</para>
                        <screen>command [options] '&lt;target>' &lt;function> [arguments]</screen>

            <title>Explore all Available Functions in the Test Module</title>
            <procedure>
                <step>
                    <para>You can use <command>sys.list_functions</command> to print a list of all
                        available functions in a Salt module. For example call <command>salt
                            minion_name sys.list_functions test</command> to see all functions in
                        the test module:</para>
                    <screen># salt minion_name sys.list_functions test
