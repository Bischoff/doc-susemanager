    <title>Preparing and Registering a Client</title>
    <para> Registering clients with SUSE Manager is done with a bootstrap script that deploys all
        necessary information to the clients. The bootstrap script contains several parameters which
        define which channel a client system will have access to. Two of these parameters
        are:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>Activation Keys</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) Keys</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The first parameter (Activation Keys) should be created from the web-GUI. These keys
        should be created and assigned to a previously added software channel. These keys act as
        identifiers for specific channels, and all client systems associated with a channel key will receive
        updates from the  channel its key is associated with. By design a client may only be connected to one base
        channel through its activation or GPG key. This quick-start guide does not cover GPG key
        usage. For more information on using GPG Keys with Bootstrap see: <ulink url="">Using
            Bootstrap with GPG Keys: Reference Guide</ulink><remark>Add this link!</remark> For a
        list of client operating systems supported by SUSE Manager, refer to Section 3.1.2,
        “Supported Client Systems”.</para>
