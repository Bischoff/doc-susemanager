        <title>Configuration Management Overview</title>
        <para>Salt is capable of applying states by matching minions with relevant state data. This
            data comes from &susemgr; in the form of package and custom states.</para>

        <title>State Data: Levels of Hierarchy</title>
        <para>State data comes from &susemgr; in the form of package and custom states and targets
            minions at three specific levels of hierarchy. The state hierarchy is defined by the
            following order or priority: Individual minions have priority on packages and custom
            states over groups. Next a group has priority over the organization.</para>

        <para>This would lead to the following order of hierarchy:</para>

    <sect1>
        <title>Salt States Storage Locations</title>
        <para>The &susemgr; salt-master reads its state data from three file root locations.</para>
        <para>The directory <replaceable>/usr/share/susemanager/salt</replaceable> is used by
            &susemgr; and comes from the susemanager-sls. It is shipped and updated together with
            &susemgr; and includes certificate setup and common state logic to be applied to
            packages and channels.</para>

        <para>The directory <replaceable>/srv/susemanager/salt</replaceable> is generated by
            &susemgr; and based on assigned channels and packages for minions, groups and
            organizations. This file will be overwritten and regenerated. This could be thought of
            as the &susemgr; database translated into salt directives.</para>

        <para>The third directory <replaceable>/srv/salt</replaceable> is for custom state data,
            modules etc. &susemgr; does not operate within or utilize this directory. However the
            state data placed here affects the Highstate of minions and is merged with the total
            state result generated by &susemgr;. </para>

    </sect1>
    <sect1>
        <title>&susemgr; States</title>
        <para>All sls files created by users will be saved to disk on the salt-master server. These
            files will be placed in <replaceable>/srv/susemanager/salt/</replaceable> and each
            organization will be placed within its own directory. Although these states are custom,
            these states are created using &susemgr;. The following provides an overview of
            directory structure:
            <screen>├── manager_org_DEVEL
│   ├── files
│   │    ... files needed by states (uploaded by users)...   
│   └── state.sls
         ... other sls files (created by users)...
E.g.:
├── manager_org_TESTING
│   ├── files
│   │   └── motd     # user created
│   │    ... other files needed by states ...
│   └── motd.sls     # user created
            ... other sls files ...</screen></para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
        <title>Pillar Data Exposed by &susemgr;</title>
        <para>SUSE Manager exposes a small amount of internal data like group membership,
            organization membership and file roots as pillars which can be used with custom sls
            states. These are managed by &susemgr; or by the user.</para>

        <para>To avoid hard-coding organization id's within sls files, a pillar entry is added for
            each organization: <screen>org-files-dir: relative_path_to_files</screen>This file will
            be available for all minions which belong to this organization.</para>

        <para>The following represents a Pillar example located in
                <replaceable>/etc/motd/</replaceable>:<screen>file.managed:
    - source: salt://{{ pillar['org-files-dir']}}/motd
    - user: root
    - group: root
    - mode: 644
</screen></para>
