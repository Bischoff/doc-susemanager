 <title>About &susemgr; and Spacewalk</title>
 <info/>
 <para>
  &susemgrreg;'s main purpose is to efficiently manage a set of Linux
  systems and keep them up-to-date. You can register both &slereg; and
  &rhel; client systems with the &susemgr; server.
 </para>
 <para>
  &susemgr; is based on the Spacewalk project,
  <link xlink:href="http://spacewalk.redhat.com/"/>. This allows for
  seamless migration when switching from &rh; Satellite or a Spacewalk
  server to &susemgr;. User experience and tools are mostly unchanged,
  which means that you can use the known commands and the scripts that may
  already exist on your systems.
 </para>
 <para>
  However, as &susemgr; is deployed as an appliance based on &sle;,
  some differences exist regarding environments and tools:

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Instead of connecting to &rhn;, &susemgr; connects to &ncc;
     (NCC) (<link xlink:href="http://www.novell/center"/>) to receive
     updates and patches. NCC also provides the entitlements for enabling
     specific &susemgr; functionality.

   <term>Automatic Deployment</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Automated installation on &rhel; client systems is done with
     Kickstart. For &sle; client systems, &susemgr; uses &ay;.

   <term>Command Line Tools</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The Spacewalk command line tools also work for &susemgr;.
     Additionally, symbolic links have been added for a number of commands.
     For example, <command>rhn-profile-sync</command> is also available as
     <command>mgr-profile-sync</command>.
