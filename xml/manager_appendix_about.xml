 <title>About &susemgr; and Spacewalk</title>
 <para>
  &susemgrreg;'s main purpose is to efficiently manage a set of Linux
  systems and keep them up-to-date. You can register both &slereg; and
  &rhel; client systems with the &susemgr; server.
 </para>
 <para>
  &susemgr; is based on the Spacewalk project,
  <ulink url="http://spacewalk.redhat.com/"/>. This allows for seamless
  migration when switching from &rh; Satellite or a Spacewalk server to
  &susemgr;. User experience and tools are mostly unchanged, which
  means that you can use the known commands and the scripts that may already
  exist on your systems.
 </para>
 <para>
  However, as &susemgr; is deployed as an appliance based on &sle;, some
  differences exist regarding environments and tools:

    <para>
     Instead of connecting to &rhn;, &susemgr; connects to &ncc; (NCC)
     (<ulink url="http://www.novell/center"/>) to receive updates and
     patches. NCC also provides the entitlements for enabling specific
     &susemgr; functionality.

     Automated installation on &rhel; client systems is done with Kickstart.
     For &sle; client systems, &susemgr; uses &ay;.

   <term>Command Line Tools</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The Spacewalk command line tools also work for &susemgr;. Additionally,
     symbolic links have been added for a number of commands. For example,
     <command>rhn-profile-sync</command> is also available as
     <command>mgr-profile-sync</command>.
