        <para>&susemgr; lets you efficiently manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up to
            date. It provides automated and cost-effective software management, asset management,
            and system provisioning. The new addition of Saltstack in &susemgr; 3 provides powerful
            event-driven configuration and management capabilities for fine grained control of any
            modern infrastructure. &susemgr; is now a Salt-master capable of commanding thousands of
            Salt-minions (&susemgr; Clients) via remote execution. &susemgr; is also fully
            compatible with Red Hat Satellite Server and offers seamless management of both &sle;
            and &rhel; Linux client systems.</para>
