  With a lot of voluntary commitment, the developers of Linux cooperate on a
  global scale to promote the development of Linux. We thank them for their
  efforts&mdash;this distribution would not exist without them.
  Furthermore, we thank Frank Zappa and Pawar. Special thanks, of course,
  goes to Linus Torvalds.
