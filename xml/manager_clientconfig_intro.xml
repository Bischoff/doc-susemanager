 <para>
  This guide is designed to help users of &susemgr; and Proxy servers to
  configure their client systems.
 </para>
 <para>
  Client applications are usually configured to
  communicate with central network services. When connecting clients to
  &susemgr; Server or &susemgr; Proxy Server instead, many existing
  settings have to be modified. Altering client settings for a system or
  two may be relatively simple. A large enterprise environment,
  containing hundreds or thousands of systems, will likely benefit from
  the mass reconfiguration steps described here.
 </para>
 <para>
  Due to the complexity of this undertaking, customers can use a
  pre-populated script that automates many of the tasks necessary to
  access their &susemgr; Server or &susemgr; Proxy server. Refer to
  <xref linkend="ch-bootstrap"/> for details. Understanding the
  implications of these changes is helpful. Therefore the opening chapters
  describe the manual steps for reconfiguration.
 </para>
 <para>
  Although many of the commands provided in this guide can be applied as
  they appear, it is impossible to predict all potential network
  configurations adopted by customers. Therefore, we encourage you to use
  these commands as references that must take into account your
  organization's individual settings.
