 <para>
  This guide is designed to help users of &susemgr; and Proxy servers to
  configure their client systems.
 </para>
 <para>
  Client applications are usually configured to communicate with central
  network services. When connecting clients to &susemgr; Server or
  &susemgr; Proxy Server instead, many existing settings have to be
  modified. Altering client settings for a system or two may be relatively
  simple. A large enterprise environment, containing hundreds or thousands
  of systems, will likely benefit from the mass reconfiguration steps
  described here.
 </para>
 <para>
  Due to the complexity of this undertaking, customers can use a
  pre-populated script that automates many of the tasks necessary to access
  their &susemgr; Server or &susemgr; Proxy server. Refer to
  <xref linkend="ch-bootstrap"/> for details. Understanding the implications
  of these changes is helpful. Therefore the opening chapters describe the
  manual steps for reconfiguration.
 </para>
 <para>
  Although many of the commands provided in this guide can be applied as
  they appear, it is impossible to predict all potential network
  configurations adopted by customers. Therefore, we encourage you to use
  these commands as references that must take into account your
  organization's individual settings.
