     <title>Base system upgrade to &sle; Server 11 SP3:</title>
     <para>
      The underlying &sle; Server 11 base system has been upgraded to
      Service Pack 3 (including updates).

     <title>Non-compliant systems:</title>
     <para>
      The semantics of non-compliant systems have changed. A system is
      considered non-compliant if it has packages installed which are not
      available in a channel. A non-compliant system cannot be reinstalled.
      The old semantics looked for packages in all available channels. The
      new semantics look for packages only in channels assigned to the
      system.

     <title>Channel synchronization logging:</title>
     <para>
      Logging of channel synchronization, triggered by
      <command>mgr-ncc-sync</command>, was done per channel and sync run.
      Every new sync created a new log file. A cron job was used to clean up
      older log files. With &susemgr; 2.1 there is only one log file per
      channel. All synchronization runs for a specific channel log to the
      same file. Older log files are rotated and compressed now, using
      logrotate.

     <title>Inter-Server Sync between 1.7 (master) and 2.1 (slave):</title>
     <para>
      An inter-server synchronization (ISS) between a &susemgr; 1.7
      Server as master and a &susemgr; 2.1 Server as client will succeed
      but generate an error mail to the administrator. The error email is
      harmless and can be deleted.

      Oracle DB), an additional permission (create role) will be added.
