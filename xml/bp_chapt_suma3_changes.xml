        <title>Overview of Changes</title>
        <para> You may already have experience managing your systems using SUSE Manager 2.1. The
            good news is all the features you are used to working with, (regarding the traditional
            spacewalk stack) have not changed. The only real exception is Monitoring which has been
            removed. (Further integration with Icinga, a third party monitoring solution will be
            added in the future). In SUSE Manager 3 you have been given two feature sets for
            management and therefore will need to make a decision on how the systems within your
            network will be managed. Select a management method for each of your systems based on
            the traditional Spacewalk management stack or the new Salt management stack. </para>
        <important>
            <title>Selecting a Management Method</title>
            <para>You cannot and should not mix a single system with both methods although you can
                have Salt managed systems and Spacewalk managed systems within the same network. You
                may for example have a development department and assign all machines in this
                department as Salt minions, likewise you could also have a production department and
                assign machines as Spacewalk bootstrap clients. Remember a single machine is either
                Spacewalk or Salt but never both.</para>
        </important>

        <para>Future maintenance updates will provide feature parity over time and your feedback for
            prioritization of these features is welcome! The following tables provide a comparison
            between each feature set. This includes features in development and features available
            only to their parent management stack.</para>
