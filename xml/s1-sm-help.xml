  <para>
   The &mgrinstguide; provides detailed information regarding &susemgr;
   server and its installation and initial configuration. Implementing a
   fully functional &susemgr; requires more than installing software and a
   database. Client systems must be configured to use &susemgr;. Custom
   packages and channels should be created for optimal use. Since these
   tasks extend beyond the basic installation, they are covered in detail in
   other guides, as well as the <citetitle>&susemgr; Installation
   Guide</citetitle>.

   &susemgr; Proxy Server is a package-caching mechanism that reduces the
   bandwidth requirements. Proxy customers cache RPMs, such as patch updates
   from &suse; or custom RPMs generated by their organization, on an
   internal, centrally-located server. Client systems then receive these
   updates from the proxy rather than by accessing the &susemgr; server
   individually. The <guimenu>&susemgr; &mgrproxyquick;</guimenu> explains
   how to install and set up a &susemgr; Proxy Server.

    RHN Proxy Server is a package-caching mechanism that reduces the
    bandwidth requirements for RHN and &susemgr; servers and enables custom
    package deployment. Proxy customers cache RPMs, such as Errata Updates
    from Red Hat or custom RPMs generated by their organization, on an
    internal, centrally-located server. Client systems then receive these
    updates from the Proxy rather than by accessing the Internet
    individually.

   By default, all &sle; client systems are configured to communicate with
   &ncc;. When connecting clients to &susemgr;, many of these settings must
   be altered. Changing client settings for a system or two may be
   relatively simple. A large enterprise environment containing hundreds or
   thousands of systems will benefit from the mass reconfiguration steps
   described in the &susemgr; &mgrclientconfguide;.

   <para>
    An Red Hat Network and RHN &susemgr; software channel is a collection of
    software packages. Channels help you segregate packages by sensible
    rules: That is, a channel may contain packages from a specific Red Hat
    Enterprise Linux version, for instance. A channel may contain packages
    for an application or family of applications. Users may also define
    channels for their own particular needs; a company may create a channel
    that contains packages for all of the organization's laptops, for
    example.
