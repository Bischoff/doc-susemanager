 <para>
  For customers who plan to build and distribute their own RPMs securely, we
  strongly recommend to sign all custom RPMs using GNU Privacy
  Guard (GPG). How to generate GPG keys and sign packages is
  covered in <xref linkend="s2-maintenance-custom-packages-gpg"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Once the packages are signed, the public key must be deployed on all
  systems by importing these RPMs, creating a central location for the public
  key for clients to retrieve it from, then adding the key to the local GPG
  keyring for each system. Follow these steps:

 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    Use the Web interface recommended for deploying &susemgr; client
    applications to create a central location for the public keys. (Refer to
    <xref linkend="s1-latest-clients-deploying"/>.) Create a public
    directory on the Web server and place the GPG public key in it:
   </para>
<screen>
<command>cp</command> <replaceable>/some/path/YOUR-RPM-GPG-KEY</replaceable> /srv/www/htdocs/pub/
</screen>
   <para>
    The key can then be downloaded by client systems using <command>wget</command>:
   </para>
<screen>
<command>wget http://</command> <replaceable>your_susemgr.your_domain.com/pub/YOUR-RPM-GPG-KEY</replaceable>
</screen>
   <para>
    Remember to replace the <replaceable>YOUR-RPM-GPG-KEY</replaceable> variable with
    the filename of your key.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Once the key is available on the client file system, import it into the
    local GPG keyring using the following command:
   </para>
<screen>
<command>rpm --import</command> <replaceable>/path/to/YOUR-RPM-GPG-KEY</replaceable>
</screen>
   <para>
    Once the GPG key has been successfully added to the client, the system
    should be able to validate custom RPMs signed with the
    corresponding private key.
   </para>
