  <title>Channel Management</title>
  <sect1>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This chapter discusses the concept of channels within &susemgr; and provides a
      foundational overview of managing channels within a &susemgr; network. This includes naming,
      base and child channel relationship, deployment and maintenance of vendor and custom channels
      for &susemgr; Server and &susemgrproxy; Server as well as the &susemgr; channel life cycle and
      various security options. This chapter also provides information about repositories, cloning,
      and staging with &susemgr;. </para>

    <title>What are Channels?</title>

    <para>Channels in &susemgr; represent the installation media for your clients. Like other media
      types channels contain software packages, patches and updates for your clients and provide an
      administrator with strict control over what may be installed on client systems. &susemgr;
      server allows you to manage channels easily via API or Web UI
      <!-- need to add links here going to the API and CLI
        documentation! -->. There are
      three kinds of channels used within &susemgr;.</para>
    <formalpara>
      <title>SUSE Vendor Channels</title>
      <para>SUSE Vendor Channels are maintained by SUSE Linux and cannot be changed or
        modified.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Custom Channels</title>
      <para>Custom Channels are created according to your infrastructure requirements and include
        specific packages relevant to your system needs. These may be changed and modified.</para>
    </formalpara>
    <formalpara>
      <title>Repositories</title>
      <para>Repositories are used to import packages from existing repositories into a software
        channel or channels.</para>

    <title> Base Channels vs. Child Channels</title>
    <para>It is important to understand the concept of <systemitem>base</systemitem> channels and their relationship
      to <systemitem>child</systemitem> channels when administering channels within &susemgr;. Channels are organized in a
      tree format in &susemgr; a base(parent) channel and multiple child channels. A client system
      must be assigned to a single base channel as this provides a clients main installation media.
      You may not have more than one base channel assigned to a client, although a single base
      channel may be assigned multiple child channels.</para>
