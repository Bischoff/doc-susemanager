    <title>What are Channels?</title>
   
    <para>Channels in &susemgr; represent the installation media for your clients. Channels contain
      the software packages for your clients and provide an administrator with strict control over
      what may be installed on client systems. &susemgr; server allows you to manage channels easily
      via API or Web UI <remark>need to add links here going to the API and CLI
        documentation!</remark>. There are three kinds of channels used within &susemgr;.</para>

    <title> Base Channels vs. Child Channels</title>
    <para>It is important to understand the concept of base(parent) channels and their relationship
      to child channels when administering channels within &susemgr;. Channels are organized in a
      tree format in &susemgr; a base(parent) channel and multiple child channels. A client system
      must be assigned to a single base channel as this provides a clients main installation media.
      You may not have more than one base channel assigned to a client, although a single base
      channel may be assigned multiple child channels.</para>
