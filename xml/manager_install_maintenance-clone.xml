 <para>
  You may limit outages caused by hardware or other failures by entirely
  cloning the &susemgr; server with its embedded database. The secondary
  server can take over if the primary one fails. To clone the &susemgr;
  server, perform these tasks:

   <para>
    Clone the &susemgr; server at the operating system level (OS level)
    with your backup tools (e.g., <command>rsync</command>) to a separate
    machine. As needed, repeat this step daily.
   </para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Back up the primary &susemgr; database daily using the commands
    described in <xref linkend="s1-config-smdb"/>. If this is done, only
    changes made the day of the failure will be lost.

   <para>
    Establish a mechanism to copy the backup to the secondary &susemgr;
    and keep the repositories synchronized using a file transfer program
    such as <command>rsync</command>. If you are using a SAN, copying is not
    necessary.

   <para>
    Use the <command>smdba</command> <option>backup-restore</option>
    subcommand to import the database backup data.

   <para>
    If the primary &susemgr; fails, change DNS to point to the new
    machine or configure your load-balancer accordingly.
   </para>

 <warning>
  <para>
   The database backup is valid only on an identical system clone, which can
   be restored only from the backup as described above. The database backup
   will not work on a system that you reinstalled from NCC!
