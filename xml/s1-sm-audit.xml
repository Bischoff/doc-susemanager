  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Make sure that the CVE data is up-to-date.  For more
     information, see <xref linkend="sec-cve-maint"/>.

    <para>
     <!--In the Web interface, -->Click the <guimenu>Audit</guimenu> tab to
     open the <guimenu>CVE Audit</guimenu> page.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
    Input a 13-char CVE identifier in the <guimenu>CVE
    Number</guimenu> field. The year setting will be automatically
    adjusted. Alternatively, set the year manually and add the last
    four digits.
    </para>

    <para>
    Optionally, uncheck the patch statuses you are not interested in.

   <step>
    <para>
     Click <guimenu>Audit systems</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
   Then a list of client systems is displayed, where each system comes
   with a <guimenu>Patch Status</guimenu> describing its situation
   regarding the given CVE identifier. Possible statuses are:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>
     Affected, patch is available in a channel that is not assigned:
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The system is affected by the vulnerability and &susemgr; has a
      patch for it, but at this moment, the channel offering the patch
      is not assigned to the system.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Affected, patch available in an assigned channel:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The system is affected by the vulnerability, &susemgr; has a patch
     for it in a channel that is directly assigned to the system.

   </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Not affected:</term>
   <listitem>

  </para>
  <note>
   <title>Unknown CVE Number</title>
   <para>
    If the CVE number is not known to &susemgr;, an error message is
    displayed because &susemgr; is unable to collect and
    display any audit data.
   </para>
  </note>
  <para>
   For each system, the <guimenu>Next Action</guimenu> column contains
   suggestions on the steps to take in order to address the
   vulnerabilities.  Under these circumstances it is either sensible to
   install a certain patch or assign a new channel. If
   applicable, a list of <quote>candidate</quote> channels or patches is
   displayed for your convenience.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can also assign systems to a <guimenu>System Set</guimenu> for
   further batch processing.

  <title>API Usage</title>

  <para>
   An API method called
   <literal>audit.listSystemsByPatchStatus</literal> is available to run
   CVE audits from custom scripts. Details on how to use it are
   available in the API guide.
  </para>
  </sect2>

 <sect2 id="sec-cve-maint">
  <title>Maintaining CVE Data</title>

  <para>
   To produce correct results, CVE Audit must periodically refresh the
   data needed for the search in the background. By default, the
   refresh is scheduled at 11:00 PM every night. It is recommended to
   run such a refresh right after the &susemgr; installation
   to get proper results immediately instead of waiting until the
   next day.
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
   <para>
    In the Web interface, click the <guimenu>Admin</guimenu> tab.
   </para>
   </step>
   <step>
   <para>
    Click <guimenu>Task schedules</guimenu> in the left menu.

   </step>
   <step>
   <para>
    Click the <literal>Single Run Schedule</literal> button.
   </para>
   </step>
   <step>
   <para>
    After some minutes, refresh the page and check that the scheduled run status is <literal>FINISHED</literal>. 
   </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
   A direct link is also available in the <guimenu>CVE Audit</guimenu>
   tab.
  </para>
 </sect2>
  <sect2 id="sec-cve-tips">
   <title>Tips and Background Information</title>
   <para>
    Audit results are only correct if the assignment of channels to
    systems did not change since the last scheduled refresh (normally
    at 11:00 PM every night). If a CVE audit is needed and channels were
    assigned or unassigned to any system during the day, a manual run is
    recommended.  For more information, see <xref linkend="sec-cve-maint"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Systems are called <quote>affected</quote>, <quote>not
    affected</quote> or <quote>patched</quote> not in an absolute sense,
    but based on information available to &susemgr;. This implies that
    concepts such as <quote>being affected by a vulnerability</quote> have
    particular meanings in this context. The following definitions apply:
   </para>

   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System affected by a certain vulnerability:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
    A system which has an installed package with version lower than the version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability.
    </para>
   </listitem>
    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
     <term>System not affected by a certain vulnerability:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant
     patch marked for the vulnerability.
    </para>
   </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System patched for a certain vulnerability:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>A system which has an installed package with version equal to
    or greater than the version of the same package in a relevant patch
    marked for the vulnerability.</para>
   </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Relevant patch:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>A patch known by &susemgr; in a relevant channel.</para>
   </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Relevant channel:</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A channel managed by &susemgr;, which is either assigned to the
     system, the original of a cloned channel which is assigned to the
     system, a channel linked to a product which is installed on the
     system or a past or future service pack channel for the system.
    </para>
   </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para>
    A notable consequence of the above definitions is that results can
    be incorrect in cases of unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or
    non-compliant systems.
