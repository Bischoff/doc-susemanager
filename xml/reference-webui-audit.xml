   <title>Maintaining CVE Data</title>
   <para> To produce correct results, CVE Audit must periodically refresh the data needed for the
    search in the background. By default, the refresh is scheduled at 11:00Â PM every night. It is
    recommended to run such a refresh right after the &susemgr; installation to get proper results
    immediately instead of waiting until the next day. </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-cve-tips">
   <title>Tips and Background Information</title>
   <para> Audit results are only correct if the assignment of channels to systems did not change
    since the last scheduled refresh (normally at 11:00 PM every night). If a CVE audit is needed
    and channels were assigned or unassigned to any system during the day, a manual run is
    recommended. For more information, see <xref linkend="sec-cve-maint"/>. </para>
   <para> Systems are called <quote>affected</quote>, <quote>not affected</quote> or
     <quote>patched</quote> not in an absolute sense, but based on information available to
    &susemgr;. This implies that concepts such as <quote>being affected by a vulnerability</quote>
    have particular meanings in this context. The following definitions apply: </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System affected by a certain vulnerability:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para> A system which has an installed package with version lower than the version of the same
       package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System not affected by a certain vulnerability:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para> A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant patch marked for the
       vulnerability. </para>

    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System patched for a certain vulnerability:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para> A system which has an installed package with version equal to or greater than the
       version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the vulnerability. </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Relevant patch:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para> A patch known by &susemgr; in a relevant channel. </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Relevant channel:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para> A channel managed by &susemgr;, which is either assigned to the system, the original of
       a cloned channel which is assigned to the system, a channel linked to a product which is
       installed on the system or a past or future service pack channel for the system. </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para> A notable consequence of the above definitions is that results can be incorrect in cases
    of unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or non-compliant systems. </para>
