   <title>Maintaining CVE Data</title>

    To produce correct results, CVE Audit must periodically refresh the data
    needed for the search in the background. By default, the refresh is
    scheduled at 11:00 PM every night. It is recommended to run such a
    refresh right after the &susemgr; installation to get proper results
    immediately instead of waiting until the next day.

   <title>Tips and Background Information</title>
   <para>
    Audit results are only correct if the assignment of channels to systems
    did not change since the last scheduled refresh (normally at 11:00 PM
    every night). If a CVE audit is needed and channels were assigned or
    unassigned to any system during the day, a manual run is recommended.
    For more information, see <xref linkend="sec-cve-maint"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Systems are called <quote>affected</quote>, <quote>not affected</quote>
    or <quote>patched</quote> not in an absolute sense, but based on
    information available to &susemgr;. This implies that concepts such
    as <quote>being affected by a vulnerability</quote> have particular
    meanings in this context. The following definitions apply:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System affected by a certain vulnerability:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A system which has an installed package with version lower than the
       version of the same package in a relevant patch marked for the
       vulnerability.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System not affected by a certain vulnerability:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A system which has no installed package that is also in a relevant
       patch marked for the vulnerability.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System patched for a certain vulnerability:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A system which has an installed package with version equal to or
       greater than the version of the same package in a relevant patch
       marked for the vulnerability.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Relevant patch:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A patch known by &susemgr; in a relevant channel.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Relevant channel:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A channel managed by &susemgr;, which is either assigned to the
       system, the original of a cloned channel which is assigned to the
       system, a channel linked to a product which is installed on the
       system or a past or future service pack channel for the system.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para>
    A notable consequence of the above definitions is that results can be
    incorrect in cases of unmanaged channels, unmanaged packages, or
    non-compliant systems.
