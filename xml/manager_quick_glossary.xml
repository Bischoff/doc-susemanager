    <para>
     A channel contains one or more repositories. Channels help you
     segregate packages by sensible rules: for instance, a channel may
     contain packages from a specific distribution. A channel may contain
     packages for an application or family of applications. Users may also
     define channels for their own particular needs; for example, a company
     may create a channel that contains packages for all of the
     organization's laptops.

     A base channel consists of packages based on a specific architecture

     channel but contains extra packages.
