    SUSE Manager delivers best-in-class Linux server management capabilities.
    For detailed information about the product please refer to the
    <ulink url="https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse_manager">SUSE
    Manager</ulink>
    documentation.
  </para>
  <para>
    The SUSE Manager images published by SUSE in select Public Cloud
    environments are provided as Bring Your Own Subscription (BYOS)
    images and need to be registered with the customer center. After an
    instance is launched SUSE Manager needs to be set up and configured
    following the procedure in the SUSE Manager documentation.

          Minimal free disk space for SUSE Manager 15G. For public cloud
          instances we recommend that the repositories and the SUSE Manager
          database be located on an external virtual disk. The details of
          this setup are provided in the
          <link linkend="using-separate-storage-volume">Using Separate
          Storage Volume</link> section.
        </para>
        <para>
          Storing the database and the repositories on an external
          virtual disk ensures that the data is not lost should the
          instance need to be terminated for some reason.

    <para>
      Please ensure that the selected instance type matches the
      requirements listed above. Although we recommend that the database
      and the repositories are stored on a separate device it is still
      recommended to set the root volume size of the instance to 20G.

          The SUSE Manager instance must run in a network access
          restricted environment such as the private subnet of a VPC or
          with an appropriate firewall setting such that it can only be
          accessed by machines in the IP ranges you use. A generally
          accessible SUSE Manager instance violates the terms of the
          EULA.

          if you are prompted with a message that there is not enough space
          available for the setup of SUSE Manager, verify that your root
          volume is at least 20GB and double check that the instructions in

          After the completion of the YaST setup for SUSE Manager the
          application is properly configured and functional. Prior to
          accessing SUSE Manager the web browser, one additional step
          needs to be completed to create a default user.

        We recommend that the repositories and the database for SUSE Manager
        be stored on a virtual storage device. This best practice will avoid
        data loss in cases where the SUSE Manager instance may need to be
        terminated. These steps
        <emphasis role="strong">must</emphasis>
        be performed prior to running the YaST SUSE Manager setup procedure.

            Provision a disk device in the public cloud environment, refer
            to the cloud service provider documentation for detailed
            instructions. The size of the disk is dependent on the number
            of distributions and channels you intend to manage with SUSE
            Manager. For sizing information refer to
            <ulink url="https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015050">SUSE
            Manager sizing examples</ulink>. A rule of thumb is 25 GB per
            distribution per channel.

    <para>
      Cloud environments generally support the creation of new images
      from a running instance. Images created using this functionality
      are clones and contain data that will have the effect that SUSE
      Manager will treat both systems as if they were only 1 system. In
      order to let SUSE Manager handle instances of cloned images as a
      new registration apply the procedure outlined on the following
      wiki to an instance of the cloned image.
